# Command: `init` — source-grounded project initialization

> Initialization stages the harness, then uses an available capable model to derive project-scoped rules, skills and SDD role bindings from the selected project's inventory, existing policies and actual representative code. Shell scaffolding alone stays PENDING.

## Invocation

```text
spec-harness install <path> [new|integrate] [name]
spec-harness init <path> [new|integrate] [name]
spec-harness index <path> [--source <repo-relative-path> ...]
```

The installer stages files and reports `PENDING`. The synthesis receipt and `spec-harness generate-agents --check <target>` (from a checkout, `bash <spec-harness>/bin/sh-gen-agents.sh --check <target>`; with no install, `npx -y github:chohra-med/spec-harness-oss generate-agents --check <target>`) establish structural and provenance readiness only. Declare overall initialization `READY` only after a separate fresh reviewer checks that cited source lines support the rules and role bindings, package boundaries are respected, and no unresolved policy conflict remains. Keep overall status `PENDING` if an independent review context is unavailable. This is separate from the first feature's goal, tests and release gates.

## Inputs and scope

- **Required:** the selected target root; its `ai_rules/context_map.md` or `ai_rules/project_inventory.json`; all applicable project instructions; the source files named as representative by the inventory.
- **Read first:** `AGENTS.md`, `RULES.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ai_rules/`, `.memory/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.Codex/`, and the target `README.md`, following each instruction file's startup sequence. Then inspect project structure, package manifests and lockfiles, relevant tests/configuration, actual first-party source, and project-local installed skills plus capabilities explicitly exposed by the active client. Open only relevant skill candidates; do not scan unrelated global stores. Do not infer architecture from directory or dependency names.
- **Inventory:** run `spec-harness index <target>` first (the installed entrypoint is `node_modules/.bin/spec-harness index <target>` when using the npm package; with no install, `npx -y github:chohra-med/spec-harness-oss index <target>`). Repeat `--source <repo-relative-path>` up to five times to choose up to five total sources; each must be a readable, regular, in-root, first-party source file with a supported source suffix and fit the existing read limits. Invalid or unsafe selections fail without replacing the current inventory. For a package with explicit selections, those paths are its representative sample; packages without selections retain the default sample. Re-pass the flags on every index run. Omitting `--source` preserves the existing default selection. Prefer `ai_rules/project_inventory.json` when it exists; otherwise consume a generated `ai_rules/context_map.md`. JSON parsing supports `package.json` and `pyproject.toml` only. Keep other manifest formats visibly unsupported. Read-only inventory paths/hashes are leads; open the actual source before making a claim.
- **Allowed writes:** fill only explicit Spec Harness scaffolds or owned generated regions; add missing per-package `RULES.md` and the named project skills (the core skills for the receipt's schema, plus technology skills) only when absent. Record conflicts and stop that artifact as PENDING. Do not replace existing user-authored policy, skill or role content. Do not change application source, dependency versions, external settings or release state.

## Show the human first

Before synthesis, open `learning_human.html` from the target root in the user's browser: `open
learning_human.html` on macOS, `xdg-open learning_human.html` on Linux, `start learning_human.html`
on Windows. When you cannot open a browser, give them its full path instead. Tell them in one
sentence that it explains what initialisation is about to do and takes about ten minutes to read.
Then continue; do not wait for them unless they ask you to. If the file is absent, say so and
continue.

## Companion tools (optional)

Check these once and report what you find. Never install anything without the user's yes.

- **graphify** (`command -v graphify`). When present, run `graphify update .` after `index`: it
  needs no model and writes `graphify-out/graph.html`, a map of the code the user can open, plus
  `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`. Suggest adding `graphify-out/` to `.gitignore`. When absent, tell
  the user once how to add it (`docs/COMPANION-SKILLS.md` in the Spec Harness repository).
- **diagram-design** (a skill). When present, use it for every diagram you draw for the user.

## Synthesis procedure

1. **Map package boundaries.** Enumerate every inventory package path, manifest name/status, declared dependency names, scripts, representative sources, applicable instructions, exclusions and unsupported formats. An incomplete inventory or unsupported manifest stays `PARTIAL`; identify its effect instead of guessing.
2. **Read before deriving.** Open the applicable instructions and each package's actual representative source, plus its tests/configuration where present. Record the exact file and line span used for each observation. When correctness or currency requires outside guidance, consult official primary documentation, cite the URL and access date, and label that material a recommendation rather than an observed project fact.
3. **Apply the reusable methods after inspection.** Read `ponytail.md`, `grill-me.md`, `package-finder.md` and `skill-finder.md` from `.claude/commands/spec-harness/` (source checkout fallback: `commands/`). Apply only methods relevant to observed package/task needs. Check tool availability and actual candidate contents; unavailable Context7 coverage/version evidence or Vercel skill provenance/license/runtime evidence stays PENDING for that decision. The standalone methods can run before a synthesis receipt or feature goal exists. Do not install packages or third-party skills.
4. **Derive package rules.** For each boundary, preserve authoritative policy and fill only empty sections or explicit generated scaffolds. Make rules specific to that package path. Separate `OBSERVED` behavior from `RECOMMENDATION`; label SOLID and performance heuristics when code does not establish them. Surface rule/code contradictions for human resolution. Do not copy a rule across a TS, mobile, Python, backend or other package boundary without evidence that it applies there. Keep volatile literals such as a test count out of rules and skills; state the command and the comparison instead, so the next ticket does not make them stale.
5. **Create the project skills.** Create the core skills from `.claude/spec-harness/methods/spec-harness-{architecture,performance,packages}.md` (source checkout fallback: `templates/project-skills/`), at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. A first initialisation (no `.claude/agents/.init-synthesis.json` in the target) also creates `spec-harness-quality` and `spec-harness-conduct` from `.claude/spec-harness/methods/spec-harness-{quality,conduct}.md` (same fallback), and writes schema 2 with those five core skills. A guarded refresh of an existing schema-1 receipt keeps schema 1 and its three skills unless the user asks to adopt five. Then follow `spec-harness-tech.md` from the same directory to add one `spec-harness-tech-<technology>` skill for each major technology the source actually uses, at most five, each scoped to the packages that use it. On first initialization, create a skill only when its name is absent; preserve any existing name and report `CONFLICT/PENDING`. On a later guarded refresh, reuse or refresh an existing skill only when its prior receipt, source-bound marker, documented generated ownership and exact preimage all agree and no custom edit intervened. Otherwise preserve its bytes and report `CONFLICT/PENDING`. Each generated skill states package applicability, cites the supporting source lines, and carries an inventory-hash source-bound marker. The structural check treats the upper-case word `PENDING` in generated rules and skills, and `generated at init` or unfilled `{{TOKEN}}` scaffolds in rules, as unfinished; describe an open owner question as `UNRESOLVED`.
6. **Select and bind roles.** Bind the applicable existing `sdd-*.md` roles through their `GEN:rules` blocks. The initialized set must include project-aware `sdd-planner`, `sdd-implementer`, `sdd-tester`, `sdd-verifier` and `sdd-reviewer`; ticket planning uses the bound planner, and tester, verifier and reviewer are separate fresh contexts. Select `sdd-merger` only when the target has an explicit merge-authority policy and the current task needs a merge decision; its binding must cite that authority. Select design and workflow roles only when project or task evidence shows those surfaces exist. `sdd-learner` owns the learning procedure; it is harness-owned and needs no source binding or receipt row. Record why optional roles are selected or excluded. Preserve all text outside the generated markers. Never infer an available runtime role from a Claude agent's `model:` frontmatter; native client dispatch must be capability-checked by that client.
7. **Write the receipt.** Create `.claude/agents/.init-synthesis.json` with the schema version step 5 selects, the chosen inventory path and SHA-256, status, package rule outputs, skill outputs, selected/excluded role bindings, source citations and any pending reasons. Record file hashes for each output and citation hashes/line spans for every source.
8. **Check structure and provenance.** Before any refresh reindex, snapshot the old receipt, inventory, selected package rules, all skills and selected roles byte-for-byte with hashes; confirm trusted generated ownership and no intervening edit. Then follow the guarded refresh owned by `.claude/commands/sdd.md`. A receipt hash is not write authority. Preserve populated human rules without an authorized generated region, custom/mismatched skills and unproven outputs byte-for-byte as `CONFLICT/PENDING`. After re-grounding affected claims, enumerate and refresh every stale raw-inventory marker consumer across all project skills and selected role GEN blocks, then run `bash <spec-harness>/bin/sh-gen-agents.sh --check <target>`. A failed check names the missing, stale, conflicting or unsupported evidence. A passing result confirms recorded structure and current cited bytes; it does not establish that the claim follows from the citation.
9. **Review claims independently.** In a separate fresh reviewer context, inspect each generated rule, skill and role claim against its cited source span; check package scope, policy conflicts, and whether any recommendation is mislabeled as observed behavior. Record that review and its outcome. If a source cannot be read or does not independently support the claim, or no independent review context is available, leave overall initialization PENDING.

## Status contract

- `PENDING`: synthesis has not run, a conflict exists, a citation is absent/invalid, an output is a stub, a role binding is unresolved/stale, or the check did not pass.
- `PARTIAL`: some package evidence is unsupported or the inventory is incomplete. List covered and uncovered package paths; overall initialization remains PENDING.
- `READY`: all inventoried package paths have checked rules, the core skills for the receipt's schema, any technology skills and required fresh role bindings are checked without conflict, the synthesis receipt passes the structural/provenance check, and the separate fresh semantic review accepts the cited claims.

The receipt checker can print `READY` for structural/provenance integrity while overall initialization remains PENDING pending semantic review. Overall `READY` does not mean a feature goal, test suite, human approval or release gate is complete.

## Output

Report the inventory source and completeness, every package path and rule file, every skill path, selected and excluded roles with reasons, citations, unsupported formats, exact readiness command/output, and any PENDING reasons. Do not claim a model dispatch occurred unless the current client confirms it.
