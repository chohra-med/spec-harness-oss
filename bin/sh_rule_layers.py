"""Schema 4 rule-layer checks for the readiness check (bin/sh-gen-agents.sh --check).

One fact, one home:
- business rules and standard commitments (`STD-`) live in `.memory/10-product.md`, decisions in
  `.memory/60-decisions.md`;
- package versions live only in `ai_rules/stack.md` (bin/sh_stack.py);
- every rule is one line, `- **ID** sentence. (source: ...)`, written once in one rule file;
- baseline and tool modules copy curated pack lines from `templates/rule-packs/` byte for byte;
- skills and role blocks name rule IDs and link to the stack; they never copy a rule or a version.

`check(...)` reports each defect through the caller's `fail` and returns the parsed rules, so the
policy ledger can require that a captured requirement's anchor is a rule ID.
