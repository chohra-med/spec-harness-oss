Bare issue names without a retrievable body stop for clarification. Produces a feature-owned specs/<feature>/ packet and goal." \

Use when the user says 'test the workflows', 'try to break the app', 'which critical flows are broken', 'run the workflow tester', or 'is checkout/onboarding still working'. The tester checks reality against critical journeys alongside the verifier's goal check. \`--scan\` and \`tester <id>\` use a capable client; the shell reports PENDING/manual. A BROKEN result sends its repro and candidate guard through reviewed learning; policy changes require approval." \

Aggregate a ranked report; send each BROKEN repro, likely cause and candidate guard through commands/learn.md for capture, classification and review. Apply a policy change only after approval.
