"""doctor: a read-only report on one target's Spec Harness setup.

It reports three separate fields, because they are separate facts:
- structural: the staged files are present and filled, and `generate-agents --check` prints READY;
- semantic: whether the generated rules say true things about the code. Only a separate fresh
  reviewer can decide that, so doctor reports NOT_ASSESSED;
- client: whether the coding client actually loads the startup files. Doctor can see that a startup
  route is written down, not that a client follows it, so it reports NOT_ASSESSED with that evidence.

- guards: a separate field with six checks that keep the V1 setup from silently breaking
  (`claude_imports_agents`, `hook_registered`, `lens_present`, `memory_complete`) plus two about the
  edit guard hook: `hook_python` (python3 on PATH, or the hook fails open) and `runs_current` (open and
  expired runs and tickets, listed). `hook_registered` is OK only when the registered matcher equals the
  registrar's. Each is OK, MISSING or NOT_APPLICABLE, with a one-line note in `guards_notes`. Guards never change structural or the
  exit code, so a target installed before the hook existed is not suddenly PENDING.

- memory and index: advisory fields that never change structural or the exit code. `memory` gives the size of
  each Hot memory file (OK, WARN from 3,200 bytes, OVER above 4,000). `index` says whether the project
  inventory is CURRENT, STALE, INCOMPLETE, UNKNOWN, MISSING or UNREADABLE, by comparing its source_head with git HEAD.

It also checks the prerequisites (bash, git, python 3.11+, npm, tar, a SHA-256 tool) and the
platform. Guards read through sh_safe_io: links, FIFOs and oversized files are UNSAFE. The memory budget opens
each Hot candidate with O_NOFOLLOW and O_NONBLOCK and checks it with fstat, so a link or FIFO is never read.
Exit 0 when structural is READY, 1 otherwise, 2 for a bad target.
