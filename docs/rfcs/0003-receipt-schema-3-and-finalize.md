# RFC 0003: receipt schema 3 and finalize-init

Status: Accepted. Implemented in 0.4.0.

## Problem

`CONTRIBUTING.md` (section "Proposals") says a change that alters a route, a receipt schema or a
status word starts as an RFC. The 0.4.0 hardening adds a receipt schema version, a set of
`finalize-init` journal statuses and a `doctor` report vocabulary. None of them had a written record
outside the code, so an operator or a reviewer could not tell which words were promised and which
were incidental.

This RFC records what the code does. It proposes nothing new. Every fact cites `file:line` in the
`bin/` files at the commit that adds this RFC. If those files change, the line numbers move and this
record must be updated with them.

## Proposal

### 1. Receipt `schema_version`

The receipt is `.claude/agents/.init-synthesis.json`. The readiness check accepts exactly the integers
1, 2 and 3 and fails any other value (`bin/sh-gen-agents.sh:67`).

| `schema_version` | When it is written | What it adds | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | a guarded refresh of an existing schema 1 receipt | the three core skills `spec-harness-architecture`, `spec-harness-performance`, `spec-harness-packages` | `bin/sh-gen-agents.sh:354`, `:499` |
| 2 | a first initialisation | schema 1 plus `spec-harness-quality` and `spec-harness-conduct` | `bin/sh-gen-agents.sh:355`, `:499` |
| 3 | the project's policy files are recorded in the receipt | schema 2 plus `policy_sources` and `policy_coverage` | `bin/sh-gen-agents.sh:67`, `:348-350`; `commands/generate-agents.md:47` |

Schema 1 and 2 receipts keep their meaning and are not asked for a policy ledger
(`commands/generate-agents.md:52`).

Schema 3 fields (checked only when `schema_version` is 3, `bin/sh-gen-agents.sh:348-350`):

- **`policy_sources`**: one row per project policy file, with `path`, `sha256` and a non-empty
  `requirement_ids` list with no duplicates. Read in `check_policy_ledger` (`:232-258`).
- **`policy_coverage`**: exactly one row per requirement id, with `id`, `path`, `sha256`,
  `line_start`, `line_end` and `disposition` (`:259-279`). The allowed dispositions are `captured`,
  `not-applicable`, `conflict` and `owner-decision` (`:281`).
  - `captured` must name a `rule_path` that is a registered rule output and a `rule_anchor` that
    appears in that file (`:283-287`).
  - `not-applicable`, `conflict` and `owner-decision` need a `reason` (`:288-289`).
  - `conflict` and `owner-decision` always fail (`:290-291`), so the receipt stays PENDING until they
    are resolved.
  - A requirement id listed in `policy_sources` with no coverage row fails (`:292-295`).
- **Drift check** (`check_policy_drift`, `:298-314`): each inventory `rule_files` row that was read
  and is not receipt-generated is hashed again. A file whose bytes changed since indexing fails with
  "project policy file changed after indexing" (`:310-314`). The check does nothing unless the
  inventory is `ai_rules/project_inventory.json` (`:299-300`).

`rule_modules` is optional in every schema, not only schema 3 (`bin/sh-gen-agents.sh:341-343`). A
package row may list package-local topic files at `<package>/ai_rules/rules/<name>.md` (`ai_rules/rules/<name>.md`
at the root). Each entry has a topic-slug `name`, the exact `path`, `sha256` and `citations`, and the
file must be linked from that package's `RULES.md` (`:190-229`, especially `:225-227`).

### 2. Inventory digest (`bin/sh-index.sh`)

- **Receipt-owned generated outputs leave the inventory hash while they match the receipt.** A package
  `RULES.md` or a `rule_modules` file whose current sha256 equals the value the receipt recorded is
  written as `"ownership": "receipt-generated"` with no `sha256` and no `bytes` (`bin/sh-index.sh:527-530`).
  Ownership is read from the receipt by `receipt_owned_rule_digests` (`:160-220`). The reason is in its
  docstring (`:161-165`): those files carry the inventory digest in their own bytes, so hashing them
  would make the inventory depend on its own output.
- **A registered output that cannot be read safely stops the run.** The index exits 1 with PENDING
  (`:522`), or with PENDING when a registered output is missing, linked or not a regular file
  (`:538-540`).
- **The finalize lock is not an inventory input.** `.claude/agents/.sh-finalize.lock` is in
  `GENERATED_IDENTITY_PATHS` (`:56-57`), so a lock held during a finalize run does not change the
  inventory.
- **Not a change in this release:** the inventory's `project_root_name` is the fixed label `.`
  (`bin/sh-index.sh:645`). It was already `.` at the base commit (`e6f6249`, line 565). The digest does
  not depend on the checkout folder name, and this RFC does not claim that as new.
- **`--preview`** (`:115-118`, `:796-800`) writes the exact bytes the index would write to stdout and
  exits 0 without writing anything.

### 3. `finalize-init` journal statuses

`bin/sh-finalize-init.py` records a `status` in its journal (`journal.json` in `--evidence-dir`).

The run's **commit point** is the point after which the run has written every new file and its final
`STRUCTURAL_READY` status, and has released the lock. This section and the guide use the term in that sense only.

Enumerated with `grep -n '"status"\]\s*=\|status": "' bin/sh-finalize-init.py`. COMPLETE: the grep
returns six write sites, lines 571, 574, 622, 646, 657 and 743. Lines 571 and 743 each set one of two
values by a conditional, so the set below has seven words.

| Status | Written at | Meaning | Process exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | `:622` | journal created before any target write | stays on disk only when the process dies before its next status write |
| `APPLYING` | `:646` | set before each target file is replaced | stays on disk only after an abrupt stop mid-write |
| `STRUCTURAL_READY` | `:657` | every write applied; a second index reached the same inventory; the success line prints at `:683` | 0 (`:688`). Kept after the commit point when the top-level rollback is refused (another run holds the lock) or its lock step fails (exit 1, `:544`, `:609-610`), or when an interrupt lands in the interpreter's own exit (exit 0; see the lock rule) |
| `ROLLED_BACK` | `:571` | set by `roll_back` (`:553`) after a complete restore: a refusal (raised at `:671`), a tool step past `TOOL_TIMEOUT` (600 s, `:46`; the refusal is at `:317`), an unnamed failure (re-raised at `:679`), or an interrupt (`interrupted_exit`, `:585`); restore put back every prior byte and found no concurrent edit | 1 for a refusal (`:671`, printed at `:829`), 1 with a traceback for an unnamed failure (`:679`), 130 for an interrupt (`:615`) |
| `RECOVERY_CONFLICT` | `:571` (from `roll_back`, called by `apply` at `:668` or by `interrupted_exit` at `:596`) or `:743` (recover) | restore found a file whose bytes are neither the prior bytes nor a postimage this run wrote; those files are kept | 1 (raised at `:670` from apply; returned at `:613` from an interrupt; raised at `:746` from recover) |
| `RECOVERY_FAILED` | `:574` | restore raised partway. The journal's `restored` list (`:475`) names the files it put back; the other written files still hold this run's bytes, so this is not a complete rollback | 1 (raised as `RollbackFailed` at `:576`; an interrupt prints the restored and the unrestored files at `:606`) |
| `RECOVERED` | `:743` (status written) | `--recover` restored the prior bytes; the success line prints at `:750` | 0 (`:752`) |

Recover refuses a journal whose status is `STRUCTURAL_READY`, `RECOVERED` or `ROLLED_BACK`
(`:705-708`). It does not refuse `RECOVERY_CONFLICT` or `RECOVERY_FAILED`, so the code path
for retrying them exists. That path is read from code (`bin/sh-finalize-init.py:698-756`). The conflict path is run by
`tests/finalize-fixtures.sh` section 6c, which applies the manual step below and then `--recover`.

**A lock left after a rollback.** A `ROLLED_BACK` journal is refused (`:708`, `already restored (ROLLED_BACK)`), so
`--recover` cannot clear a lock that a failed release left behind. `roll_back` ignores an error from its release
(`:580-581`), and `take_lock` does the same in its cleanup (`:305-307`). The lock then records a process that has
exited. The manual step is in `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`, section "Stale lock after a rollback". Before it removes
`.claude/agents/.sh-finalize.lock` by hand, it confirms four things: the journal status is `ROLLED_BACK`; the journal's
`target` is the current directory (`pwd -P`); the recorded PID (process ID: the number the operating system gives a
running program) is digits only and is not running; and the lock still holds that PID just before the removal. The
check covers processes on this machine only. A lock on a shared volume, or one written by a finalizer in another
container or on another computer, is not detected by it, so the step must not be used for such a lock. The target
check shows only that the journal names this directory. The procedure cannot tell which run wrote the lock beyond
that (named follow-up, "Not in 0.4.0"). This list is a summary. The full set of checks is in `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`, section "Stale lock after a rollback".

**Files this run never wrote.** `restore` skips a journaled file whose `expected_after` is empty (`:477-478`). Such a
file is neither put back nor a conflict, so a human edit to it is kept and the rollback completes (fixture 6r). Only
files this run wrote are restored or can conflict.

**Manual step for a conflict.** `--recover` restores a file only when its bytes are the journal's prior
bytes or a postimage this run wrote. Any other content stays a conflict, so a hand edit clears it only when
the result is the prior bytes. For each file the message names, write the bytes its journal entry records
(`files[<path>].before`, base64-decoded) back to the file, then run
`spec-harness finalize-init <target> --recover --evidence-dir <dir>`. This overwrites a concurrent edit, so save
that edit first if it matters. The steps are in `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`.

The conflict message has one of two forms, depending on the path that kept the files. Both end with `; lock kept.`

- From `--apply`, or from an interrupt (`conflict_message`, `:547`, after the failure text): `concurrent edits kept, manual recovery needed: <path>`
- From `--recover` (`:746`): `concurrent edits kept; manual recovery needed: <path>`

**Lock rule** (after the H5 change at `c0daa34`; revised by corrections 19, 20, 21 and 25):

- `--apply` installs its signal handler (`install_signal_handlers`, `:497`, called at `:627`) and fills the run
  record `RUN` (`:62`, set at `:628`) before it takes the lock (`:629`; `take_lock` is defined at `:283`). The
  handler and the record therefore exist before the first lock call.
- **Before the handler.** Until `install_signal_handlers` runs (`:627`), SIGINT is Python's default: it raises
  `KeyboardInterrupt`, which no code in this file catches, so the process prints a traceback. The dry run never
  installs the handler, so this applies to it too. In `apply` the window runs from the evidence directory that `:621`
  creates to `:627`. Nothing is written to the target and no lock is taken in that window; the evidence directory may
  already exist and be empty. A SIGTERM there ends the process without running any code in this file. The exit code
  of the traceback path was not measured (UNVERIFIED).
- While the lock is taken, SIGINT and SIGTERM are held back (`take_lock`, `:283-308`). If a signal lands after
  this run created the lock, the lock is removed before the interrupt propagates. A busy lock refuses at `:249`
  and leaves the lock file alone (a refusal this run did not create is never removed). The refusal exits 1
  (`:828-830`) and writes no journal. It leaves the empty `--evidence-dir` that `:621` created before the lock is
  taken, so a retry needs a new directory.
- **The commit point.** The lock is released at `:663`, after the STRUCTURAL_READY write (`:657`) and before the
  success print (`:683`) and `return 0` (`:688`). The release ends the lock's protection. It does not end the
  rollback: an interrupt after the release still rolls the run back, except in the four cases below.
  The success print sits after the rollback handlers, in its own `try` that ignores `OSError` and `ValueError`, so a
  failed print does not roll the completed run back. A closed `sys.stdout` exits 0 (fixture 6s). Other print
  failures are not covered by that fixture (see the closed-stdout rows in `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`).
- **Rollback from the top level.** After the handler is installed, a SIGINT or SIGTERM raises `Interrupted`
  (`:503-505`) on whatever line it lands, which covers the release call, the STRUCTURAL_READY write, the
  `return 0` and everything before them. `apply` does not catch it. It reaches `__main__` (`:825-833`), which
  calls `interrupted_exit` (`:585`). That calls `roll_back` (`:553`), the same path `apply` uses on a refusal
  (`:668`). `roll_back`:
  1. ignores both signals (`:560`), so a second signal cannot interrupt the rollback;
  2. holds the lock before it writes (`hold_lock_for_rollback`, `:530`). If the run released the lock at its commit point and
     nothing took it, it takes it again with `take_lock` (`:538`), with the same mask and `O_EXCL`. It keeps a
     lock only when this run created it (`LOCK_CREATED`, `:65`, set at `:299`, cleared by `release_lock` at `:280`)
     and the file still records this process. A lock this run did not create is never removed, even when it records
     this process's PID (fixture 6m). If another run holds it, the attempt is refused with the `acquire_lock` message
     (`:249`) and nothing is written. If the lock step raises an OSError, the attempt is refused as
     `cannot take the finalize lock for the rollback` (`:544`), again with nothing written (fixture 6n);
  3. restores every journaled file (`:570`) and records the outcome in the journal;
  4. releases the lock only when the status is `ROLLED_BACK` and no file conflicts (`:577-579`). It keeps the lock for `RECOVERY_CONFLICT`
     and `RECOVERY_FAILED`.
  `interrupted_exit` returns 130 when every write is rolled back (`:615`).
- **Race refused.** When another run holds the lock at the moment the top-level rollback starts (a second
  finalizer took it after the commit point), the rollback refuses (raised at `:541` from `hold_lock_for_rollback`, re-raised at `:568`) and writes nothing.
  It leaves the other run's lock alone. The refusal text begins with the original failure, then names the lock
  refusal (`:568`), so a failure whose rollback is refused prints both (fixture 6q). `interrupted_exit` prints the
  refusal and returns 1 (`:609-610`). The
  status stays `STRUCTURAL_READY`, and the journal's `failure` field records `rollback refused`, so the
  completed run is kept. Fixture 6l measures this case.
- **Four cases where an interrupt after the first target write does not roll back.** Three of them exit 1, and one exits 0. (1) A refused rollback, which exits 1 whether or not it passed the commit point:
  another run holds the lock (`:541`), or the lock step fails (`:544`); both are re-raised at `:568`. Nothing is rolled
  back, the target's files are as the interrupt left them; the lock step can create and remove the lock file on the way, and the command exits 1. The status depends on the commit point: after it the completed run is kept (`STRUCTURAL_READY`); before it, the status stays what it was.
  (2) A conflict: the rollback finds a file whose bytes are neither the prior bytes nor this run's postimage, keeps that file and the lock, and exits 1 (`interrupted_exit`, `:611-613`). (3) A
  restore that raises partway (`RECOVERY_FAILED`): some files hold the prior bytes and others still hold this run's
  bytes, the lock is kept, and the print names both sets and exits 1 (`:597-607`). (4) The interpreter's own exit,
  below, which exits 0.
- **The window that remains: the interpreter's own exit.** After `sys.exit` raises `SystemExit` out of the `try`
  in `__main__` (`:827`, and the exits at `:830` and `:833`), no code in this file is protected. The handler is
  never restored: `install_signal_handlers` (`:497`) runs once and nothing resets the default disposition. So an
  interrupt there raises `Interrupted` in code that does not catch it, on every exit path of `__main__`, not only
  after a completed run. Reported at `c01c706`, not covered by a fixture, not re-run: a SIGINT sent from an
  `atexit` hook after a completed run gave exit code 0, a traceback ending `Interrupted: SIGINT`, status `STRUCTURAL_READY`, no lock, and every byte equal to the completed
  run. The rollback does not cover this window. The exact boundary inside the exit path was not measured. After a
  refusal (exit 1) or a 130 exit, the same window exists; the exit code and output of those paths were not measured
  (UNVERIFIED).
- **Injection measurement.** A SIGINT injected at each of the 158 line events of `apply` from the first target
  write (event 67, line 610) to the last (event 224, line 629) ended with exit 130, `ROLLED_BACK`, no lock and
  every byte equal. The 158 is the count of trace line events from event 67 through event 224, both included
  (224 - 67 + 1). The table is in the correction 19 receipt. The same driver on a copy of `6136460` flagged
  10 of 166 points: 166 is every `apply` line event that driver swept in that older script, not only the write
  window, and 10 of them were not clean. These numbers were measured on the script before correction 20 (`f3d2587`), so the line numbers
  in this paragraph are that script's (`:610`, `:629`). Correction 20 changed the rollback and the success print, so
  the measurement was not repeated for the current script (UNVERIFIED).
- The first SIGINT or SIGTERM ignores both signals (`:504`), and `roll_back` sets them again (`:560`), so a
  second signal cannot interrupt the rollback.
- `--recover` adopts a lock only when the PID recorded in it is not alive (`acquire_or_adopt_lock`, `:759-781`).
  A live PID refuses (`:780`). It releases the lock only when the recovery succeeded or the lock was its own
  (`:755-756`).

### 4. `doctor` report (`bin/sh-doctor.py`)

`doctor <target>` prints one JSON object (`:160`). Its fields, in order of the report dictionary
(`:146-159`):

- `target`, `structural` (`READY` or `PENDING`, `:138`), `structural_reasons`;
- `semantic` (always `NOT_ASSESSED`, `:150`), `semantic_note`;
- `client` (always `NOT_ASSESSED`, `:152`), `client_note`;
- `startup_route_in` (which of `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` names `.claude/commands/sdd.md`, `:73`);
- `paths`: a row per file with `status`;
- `synthesis_check`: `exit` and `output` of `generate-agents --check` (`:135-136`);
- `prerequisites` (`:86-100`) and `platform` (`:103-117`).

Status words, each produced by the code cited:

- path rows: `PRESENT`, `SCAFFOLD`, `MISSING`, `UNSAFE`, `UNREADABLE` (`classify`, `:42-57`);
- prerequisites: `OK`, `MISSING`, `TOO_OLD` (`:88-97`);
- platform: `SUPPORTED`, `UNSUPPORTED`, `UNTESTED` (`:103-117`).

`semantic` and `client` are never judged by doctor. A fresh reviewer decides the first, and a fresh
client session decides the second (`:5-8`).

## Not in 0.4.0

- `finalize-init` does not refresh a Markdown context map. It refuses (`bin/sh-finalize-init.py:355`).
  Only the JSON inventory is supported.
- `doctor` does not check the semantic or the client field. Both stay `NOT_ASSESSED` by design
  (`:150`, `:152`).
- `--recover` installs no signal handler. `install_signal_handlers` is called only from `--apply`
  (`:627`), so an interrupt during `--recover` is not covered by the 130 path. This is a known gap,
  not a designed behaviour.
- Run-ID binding: record a run ID and the hostname in the lock so the manual procedure can check which run wrote it. Not in this release.
- Shared-volume and container locks: not detected by the manual procedure.

## Exit codes

Every exit code the four new surfaces can produce. COMPLETE: found by `grep -n 'sys.exit\|SystemExit\|return [0-9]'`
over `bin/sh-doctor.py`, `bin/sh-finalize-init.py` and `bin/sh-index.sh`, plus the argument parsers and
the dispatcher check in `bin/spec-harness:35-41`.

| Surface | Code | Cause | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `doctor` | 0 | structural READY | `bin/sh-doctor.py:161` |
| `doctor` | 1 | structural PENDING | `:161` |
| `doctor` | 2 | target is missing or a symbolic link | `:127` |
| `finalize-init` | 0 | dry run; `--apply` reached `STRUCTURAL_READY`; `--recover` reached `RECOVERED`. An interrupt in the interpreter's own exit also exits 0. For an interrupt sent from an `atexit` hook, reported at `c01c706`, not covered by a fixture, not re-run: exit 0, a traceback ending `Interrupted: SIGINT`, journal `STRUCTURAL_READY`, no lock. The other exit points are not measured (UNVERIFIED); see the lock rule in section 3 | `:796`, `:688`, `:752` |
| `finalize-init` | 1 | a refusal (precondition, busy lock, concurrent edit, failed or conflicted rollback, a rollback refused after an interrupt because another run holds the lock, or a tool step past `TOOL_TIMEOUT`, where only its direct child is stopped and a child process it started may keep running); an unnamed failure whose rollback completes with no conflict, with a traceback | `:829` (refusals from `main`), `:609-610` and `:613` (interrupt paths), `:671` (raised by apply), `:679` (re-raised) |
| `finalize-init` | 2 | argument error (`argparse`), or Python older than 3.11 | `bin/spec-harness:35-41` |
| `finalize-init` | 130 | `--apply` interrupted by SIGINT or SIGTERM and rolled back from the top level: every write restored, the lock released (both signals; if the release itself fails, the status is still `ROLLED_BACK` and the lock file is kept, see "Stale lock after a rollback" in `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`). Not covered: an interrupt in the interpreter's own exit (exit 0, section 3); an interrupt whose rollback is refused because another run holds the lock, or whose lock step fails (exit 1); an interrupt whose rollback finds a conflict (exit 1, conflicting files and lock kept); an interrupt whose restore raises partway (exit 1, `RECOVERY_FAILED`, section 3) | `:615`, `:825-833` |
| `index --preview` | 0 | bytes printed, nothing written | `bin/sh-index.sh:800` |
| `index` | 1 | a refusal raised as a message (`SystemExit` with a string) | e.g. `:117`, `:170`, `:540` |
| `index` | 2 | no target argument, or Python older than 3.11 | `bin/sh-index.sh:7-8`, `:14`, `:21` |

An uncaught Python exception in `finalize-init` or `doctor` also exits 1 with a traceback. Neither `main` nor
`__main__` catches it, so it is not a documented status. An unnamed failure inside `apply` (`:672-679`) rolls
back first, and the output then depends on the rollback:

- (a) **The rollback completes with no conflict.** The original error re-raises (`:679`): a traceback, exit 1, and
  no rollback sentence. The journal reads `ROLLED_BACK`, which means every write was rolled back.
- (b) **The rollback finds a conflict.** A named refusal prints the conflict message with its file list (`:678`;
  fixture 6p). Exit 1.
- (c) **The rollback is refused on the lock (`:568`) or a restore fails (`:576`).** Both are raised as a `Refused`
  (`RollbackFailed` is a subclass, `:53`), so `__main__` prints a named `PENDING:` line (`:828-830`), exit 1, and no
  traceback. A refused rollback does not remove a lock it did not create. A failed restore keeps the lock and
  sets `RECOVERY_FAILED`.

An interrupt that reaches `__main__` (`:831-833`) goes to `interrupted_exit` (`:585`). `roll_back` catches only
`Refused`, `OSError` and `ValueError` during restore (`:573`), so an unnamed exception inside the rollback itself still
escapes as a traceback (not measured). The one interrupt `interrupted_exit` cannot handle is one that lands in the
interpreter's own exit (section 3).

## Test to add when accepted

Not required by this RFC: the record adds no behaviour. The enumerations above are checked by reading the
cited lines. Any later change to a status word or a schema version must come with an RFC update and a
fixture that fails without the change.
