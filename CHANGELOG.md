## Unreleased

### Added

- `commands/init.md` names every core memory file to fill, says to write `None recorded yet (YYYY-MM-DD).` where there is no evidence, and adds `spec-harness doctor <target>` reporting `structural: READY` to its READY definition. In live trials `generate-agents --check` said READY while `doctor` found six memory files still scaffolds, because init never asked for them.
- `index --same-scope` refreshes with the `--exclude-dir` and `--source` options the existing inventory recorded. Explicit sources are now recorded (`scan.explicit_sources` and a limitation line in the Markdown map), and a refresh that drops a recorded option, or whose source sample differs from an older inventory, prints a `SCOPE:` line on stderr. The source-sample line says it matters only for an inventory that an index before source recording built with `--source`. An `--exclude-dir` folder the scan never reached gets its own limitation line, so it is reused too. An older index wrote no such line, so a map from an older index (it has no `Source HEAD` line) that records an `--exclude-dir` run is refused by `--same-scope`, and a plain refresh says so in a `SCOPE:` line: run index once with the original `--exclude-dir` options. Control characters in a path are escaped in the Markdown map, so a file name cannot add a line to it; `--same-scope` and the `SCOPE:` lines trust a Markdown map only when every line fits the format index writes (a map from an older index that wrote a file name unescaped is refused), and with no `context_map.md` nothing is reused from a companion JSON inventory. In live trials a refresh without the original options had silently changed the inventory.
- A standard rule without a pack may name its source as `official text: <instrument and article>` instead of a URL with `checked YYYY-MM-DD`. A tool rule still needs the URL and the date.
- `index` parses `composer.json`: package name, script names and `require`/`require-dev` package names, each kept only when it matches Composer's package-name grammar after lower-casing (so platform requirements such as `php` and `ext-*` are left out), with framework signals for well-known frameworks by name and for the name shapes `<vendor>/framework`, `<vendor>/framework-bundle` and `<vendor>/product-<edition>-edition`. A PHP project's inventory no longer reports its manifests as unsupported, which kept `generate-agents --check` from ever printing READY. A malformed or non-object `composer.json` stays unsupported. A receipt may cite `composer.json` like `package.json`. `ai_rules/stack.md` still lists npm and Python versions only.
- The router's `## Route` block gains `type: code | doc | research | decision | review`. `/sdd` copies it with the class, reads a missing `type` as `code`, and for a non-code type takes "tests" to mean the checks the goal and the lens name. Proposal: RFC 0007 (`docs/rfcs/0007-lens-briefs-statuses.md`).
- Gate briefs: for LITE and FULL, `plan.md` carries `## Gate briefs` (`### Tester brief`, `### Reviewer brief`), inside the approved bytes. A brief may add checks and never drops a lens item.
- The reviewer works in two passes in one fresh context: Pass 1 is blind to the briefs and gate records, Pass 2 reads them and writes `## What the brief missed`. A standing check asks it to search for every other place that states the same advice or reads the same flag.
- The implementer's hand-back ends with `STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT`, and `/sdd` acts on each (a missing status reads as `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`).
- Project lens: an optional `ai_rules/review-lens.md` (staged as a PENDING template, never over an existing file) holds `- **LENS-<n>** ...` checks. Each LITE and FULL review gives every item `MET`, `VIOLATED` or `NOT-APPLICABLE`; a missing verdict makes the review incomplete. `generate-agents` names the lens and its item IDs in the reviewer's `GEN:rules` block and never copies their text.
- Optional memory kinds (`content`, `automation`, `research`) staged under `.claude/spec-harness/memory-kinds/`, copied into `.memory/` by `/sdd init` on request, and `docs/MEMORY.md` with the one home per fact.
- Receipt citations may point at an inventoried, read, hash-matching project policy file (for example `AGENTS.md`) that applies to the package, beside the package's representative-source citation. Policy-only citations stay refused. Installed harness files, generated rule outputs and PENDING scaffolds are not citable policy, and a stale policy citation says "policy file" in its message.
- `commands/build.md`, `agents/sdd-tester.md` and `agents/sdd-implementer.md` agree with `/sdd` section 6: gates run only after `DONE` or `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `BLOCKED` counts as a correction round and `NEEDS_CONTEXT` does not, concerns reach the reviewer's Pass 2 only. The tester reads the task `type`.
- Edit guard hook: `hooks/sdd-gate.sh`, a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook for `Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit` and `NotebookEdit`. It guards the repo that registered it (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, else the repo around the script), never the session folder, and compares folders by identity so a differently cased path is the same folder. It blocks a write that lands inside another git working tree (a `.git` folder or file between the root and the file, also under `.claude/`, `specs/` and the other allowed folders, or above a file outside the root; a linked worktree of a harness repo too) or reaches outside the root through a link (memory, plan and temp files outside the root and outside any git tree are allowed), and blocks a source edit until some `.spec-harness/runs/*/run-state.json` lists `checkpoint` and not `summary` (run `/sdd`). `specs/`, `.spec-harness/`, `.memory/`, `.claude/`, `ai_rules/`, `learning/`, `.agents/`, `SPEC-HARNESS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and every `RULES.md` are always allowed, so `/sdd init` and learn can write. It is a gate against mistakes, not a sandbox. A MICRO ticket has no checkpoint, so an open `specs/<feature>/ticket.md` (no `RESULT: PASS` line) also allows source edits; this is weaker than a checkpoint. A run-state or open ticket not modified for 7 days is expired and no longer opens the gate; the block message names it. When a folder above the root (for example a home folder) is a git repository, files outside the root below it, such as Claude Code memory files, are blocked too. `SDD_BYPASS=1` allows and logs to `.spec-harness/bypass.log` when the call would have been blocked. An internal error allows the call with a warning. `Bash` writes are not checked. Tests: `tests/hook-fixtures.sh`.
- `install` stages the hook at `.claude/spec-harness/hooks/sdd-gate.sh` and registers it in `.claude/settings.local.json` with `bin/sh-hook-register.py` (merge, idempotent, atomic, never `settings.json`; the file is added to `.git/info/exclude` in a git target). `install-manifest.json` lists the hook and a `registrations` entry. `spec-harness update --apply` registers the hook the same way and prints a `hook registration:` line. `spec-harness uninstall` prints the command that removes only the harness entry. `package.json` ships `hooks/`.
- `spec-harness doctor` adds a `guards` field (`claude_imports_agents`, `hook_registered`, `lens_present`, `memory_complete`, `hook_python`, `runs_current`, each `OK`, `MISSING` or `NOT_APPLICABLE`) with `guards_notes`; `hook_registered` is `OK` only when the registered matcher equals the registrar's, `hook_python` says whether the hook can decide, and `runs_current` lists open and expired runs and tickets. It never changes `structural` or the exit code. New `commands/doctor.md` documents it.
- `commands/sdd.md` and `docs/RUN-STATE.md` say the orchestrator writes the existing `summary` stage when a ticket ends, accepted or abandoned. The Task type bullet applies to LITE and FULL only. The reviewer role, `commands/sdd.md` and the lens template say lines inside HTML comments are not lens items and a lens with no items means no lens.
- `commands/sdd.md` names the hook, says a block means run `/sdd` and never bypass, and says each confirmed miss becomes a rule plus a hook or a `doctor` check. `tests/sdd-fixtures.sh` checks that `tests/run-all.sh` runs every `tests/*.sh`.
- Receipt citations may also point at an in-package first-party source file that the cited package owns, beside the package's representative source; package rows still need a representative source, and policy citations never count as source. The generator also refuses nested repositories, harness files, files over 128 KiB, secret-like names and any path spelled differently from the disk (case or Unicode form), and a refusal says why.
- `tests/rule-ownership-contract.sh`: each first-initialisation, refresh and `CONFLICT/PENDING` phrase must be present in `commands/init.md` and absent from the work order, the skill generator and `commands/sdd.md`. It fails when a second copy of the rule appears. Planted-fault control: a copy of the refresh phrase in `commands/sdd.md` turns it red.

### Changed

- `index --source` and `--exclude-dir` refuse a path with a backtick or a control character, because the map cannot record it; the message says so. Earlier versions accepted such paths.
- `index` records the selected root's git HEAD as `scan.source_head` and a `- Source HEAD:` line in the map (`none` when the root is not the top of a git repository), and `spec-harness doctor` adds two advisory fields that never change `structural` or the exit code: `memory` (size of each Hot memory file: OK, WARN from 3,200 bytes, OVER above 4,000) and `index` (the inventory is CURRENT, STALE, INCOMPLETE, UNKNOWN, MISSING or UNREADABLE, from `source_head` against git HEAD).
- Upgrading: every inventory from an older index changes once on its next index run (the new `Source HEAD` line; with `--source`, also `scan.explicit_sources`; with an `--exclude-dir` folder the scan never reached, a new limitation line). Run that index with the original options, then use `--same-scope` and the guarded refresh as usual.
- `agents/sdd-implementer.md`: before handing back an edit to a TypeScript file, test files included, the implementer runs the project's typecheck command and reports its exit code. A test runner that transpiles does not typecheck.
- `commands/pr-prepare.md`: restart a bundler-served app with its cache cleared before each Before/After capture, and after any branch switch, stash or patch apply, so the captured screen matches the checked-out source.
- A policy ledger row may record `text_sha256`, the hash of its own span text. When a `.memory/` policy source changes, `generate-agents --check` finds each such row by its text (at its span, or moved to exactly one place) and stays READY with a `NOTE:` line, instead of turning PENDING on every new memory note. A row whose own text changed or is gone, or moved and is found twice, still fails, and other policy files keep the whole-file hash check. Existing receipts keep their meaning; add the field to memory rows in the next guarded refresh.
- `generate-agents --check` no longer requires a core skill or a role to cite a source file from every package it applies to, for receipts of every schema; it needs at least one source citation (a policy file still never counts). A technology skill still cites each package it lists, and each package row keeps its representative source. Generators had been repeating one span per package to satisfy the old rule (RFC 0009 draft). The semantic review now asks per package whether a multi-package skill or role's claims hold there.

### Fixed

- `generate-agents --check` refuses a `policy_sources` path listed twice. Before, the second entry replaced the first one's `requirement_ids`, so a requirement could go uncovered while the check said READY.
- `index` drops manifest names, scripts, dependencies, entrypoints and workspace patterns that contain a control character, a backtick or a lone surrogate, so a hostile manifest can no longer forge a package heading in `context_map.md` or crash the UTF-8 write; a manifest nested deep enough to exhaust the parser (`RecursionError`) is recorded as unsupported instead of stopping `index`.
- `generate-agents --check` reads "(unsupported)" and "(unreadable)" only as a manifest status on a `- Manifests:` line, so a dependency or script with that name no longer blocks READY.
- `index` prints an `INCOMPLETE:` line when the scan stops at a read limit (it names the limit, `directory limit 5000` or `file limit 25000`, and hints at `--exclude-dir`) or when some paths could not be read. Exit codes and written files are unchanged. `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` has a troubleshooting row for both wordings.
- `tests/index-fixtures.sh` covers the file-limit branch, and prints SKIP, not PASS, for the unreadable-directory check when run as root.
- Rule layers: the decisions template's example rules inside a multi-line comment are no longer read as rules, and real rule line numbers are unchanged.
- The staged `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` so Claude Code loads the same rules.
- `commands/init.md` suggests `.git/info/exclude` (local, untracked) for graphify and Understand-Anything output, and `.gitignore` only when the team wants it shared.
- `docs/COMPANION-SKILLS.md` gives the same exclude advice as `commands/init.md`.
- `commands/rules.md` says rule lines are read with HTML comments removed.
- `commands/tester.md` names the command `/tester`, the name Claude Code gives it.
- The work order printed by `generate-agents` restated the first-initialisation and guarded-refresh rules that `commands/init.md` owns, and said the quality and conduct core skills belong to "schema 2" only, while the check requires them for schemas 2, 3 and 4. It now points to `commands/init.md` step 5 and says "schema 2 or later".

## 0.6.0 - 2026-10-21

### Added

- `commands/pr-prepare.md`: an ordered checklist before a pull request is written, pushed or updated. It is
  procedure only and grants no permission to commit, push, open or merge. Proposal: RFC 0005.
- `spec-harness pr-packet PR_BODY.md [--test-names FILE] [--repo DIR --base REF --head REF]`: a read-only
  structural check of a saved PR body (sections, one Before/After image, no video, no local path, no
  placeholder, Merge Danger bullets, real test names). Claims stay UNVERIFIED. Tests:
  `tests/pr-packet-fixtures.sh`.
- The merger role has a PR packet gate: a passing packet check and a passing pipeline on the exact head,
  and dependent PRs updated or listed as PENDING.
- Rule layers, receipt schema 4 (RFC 0006). Every rule is one readable line, `- **ID** sentence. (source:
  ...)`, defined once. Each fact has one home: business rules in `.memory/10-product.md`, decisions and
  accepted conventions in `.memory/60-decisions.md`, project rules in `RULES.md` and rule modules, tool
  rules in `ai_rules/rules/tool-<package>.md`, baseline rules in `ai_rules/rules/baseline-<topic>.md`,
  and package versions only in `ai_rules/stack.md`. Conflicts follow precedence (business, decision,
  project, tool, baseline) with `overrides <ID>`; what precedence cannot settle stays open in
  `rule_conflicts`. A first initialisation writes schema 4. v1 keeps it light: packs are recommended,
  not required; the policy ledger is optional and checked when present; duplicates are rules with the same
  words; a stray version is a stack version written in full.
- `spec-harness stack <target> [--check]` (`bin/sh_stack.py`): writes `ai_rules/stack.md` from
  `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` and their lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `uv.lock`,
  `poetry.lock`). The readiness check rebuilds it and refuses READY when it is stale.
- Curated rule packs in `templates/rule-packs/`, staged to `.claude/spec-harness/rule-packs/`: baseline
  clean code, security, error handling, performance, testing and accessibility, and tool packs for Expo,
  React Native, Expo Router, TanStack Query and Sentry for React Native, each rule citing official
  documentation (checked 2026-10-21). Targets copy pack lines byte for byte; a tool pack applies only
  inside its declared version range.
- `generate-agents --check` with schema 4 (`bin/sh_rule_layers.py`) rejects pointer lines such as "Apply
  the canonical ... Coverage IDs: ...", unreadable rule lines, a rule ID defined twice, two rules with the
  same words, a reworded pack rule, a tool module outside its range, a `PROPOSED` convention, an override by a lower layer, an
  open rule conflict, a package version outside the stack, and a skill or role block that copies a rule
  instead of naming its ID. A captured ledger row anchors to a rule ID. Tests:
  `tests/rule-layers-fixtures.sh`.
- Standards and compliance (`commands/standards.md`, skill `spec-harness-standards`): init looks for
  signals (markets, personal, payment or health data, an accessibility statement or certificate), asks
  the owner once which named standards the company has (`in place`), must meet (`required`) or plans
  (`planned`), records each as a `STD-` line in `.memory/10-product.md`, and carries it out with an
  `ai_rules/rules/standard-<name>.md` module. Standard packs: `standard-eu-accessibility` (European
  Accessibility Act, Directive (EU) 2019/882, with harmonised standard EN 301 549) and
  `standard-owasp-masvs`. The catalogue also names GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27701, SOC 2, PCI DSS,
  HIPAA and IEC 62304. Precedence becomes business, standard, decision, project, tool, baseline. The check
  refuses a commitment without a status or a module, and a standard module without a commitment.
  Recording a commitment never claims compliance.
- `spec-harness index <target> --exclude-dir <dir>` (repeatable, at most 20): leaves a generated or
  vendored directory out of the scan, records it in `scan.excluded_directories`, and refuses a path that
  escapes the root, is a symlink, a file or a duplicate. Tests: `tests/index-exclusion-fixtures.sh`.
- `init` offers Understand-Anything on every run (installed only on the user's yes, pinned and recorded
  in `.memory/30-tech.md`); `docs/COMPANION-SKILLS.md` has the install lines.
- Memory bank templates: `10-product.md` has Business, Goals, Users and Domain rules sections;
  `60-decisions.md` states the one-line decision format.

### Changed

- `update` names a project's own copy of a harness procedure on its plan line ("the shipped version
  differs: merge it by hand"), so a target does not silently keep running an old `init` or `sdd` procedure.
- Schema 4 check: a business rule or decision is captured in its memory-bank home (`rule_path`
  `.memory/10-product.md` or `.memory/60-decisions.md`); the memory bank is read as human prose, where only
  well-formed rule lines are rules; and a generated output or installed harness file listed as a policy
  source is refused. `ai_rules/rules/frequent_rules.md` is a `WHEN ...: <rule IDs>` index.
- `index` leaves the generated `ai_rules/stack.md` out of the policy files it hashes, as it does the
  context map, so regenerating the stack is not policy drift.
- Technology skills and role blocks name rule IDs and link to `ai_rules/stack.md`; they no longer restate
  rules or versions (`templates/project-skills/spec-harness-tech.md`, `commands/init.md`).
- `commands/ship.md`: a check that cannot run locally may be left to CI only by a recorded project
  decision, and the report lists it as `left to CI`, not as passed.
- `commands/learn.md`: a lesson that conflicts with an adopted rule is resolved by the review authority,
  as a narrow, dated `EXPLICIT` carve-out after the rule, or as a rejected lesson.

### Fixed

- The `generate-agents` work order (step 3) now names the `conventions` and `technology-profiles`
  methods, which every install stages. `tests/portable-skills-contract.sh` checks that step 3 names each
  installed method.
- `generate-agents --check` no longer treats the lower-case word "pending" in human rule prose (for
  example "update every pending PR") as an unfinished stub. Only the upper-case marker `PENDING` counts,
  as `commands/init.md` step 5 states. `tests/synthesis-contract.sh` covers lower- and title-case prose.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-18

### Added

- `sdd-router`, a read-only role on the fast tier's smallest model (`haiku` on Claude). `/sdd`
  dispatches it before the ticket is classified; it reads the ticket, the startup rules and file names (never source contents)
  and returns a `## Route` block: class, the tier for each stage, whether to ask Grill Me and the
  files to load first. The orchestrator may raise its class, never lower it. Low confidence, a
  malformed block or no separate context falls back to the orchestrator's own classification.
- Size picks the tiers: a table in `commands/sdd.md` that maps MICRO, LITE and FULL to the tier that
  plans, implements and accepts. A MICRO ticket's single verifier runs on the fast tier.

### Fixed

- First `/sdd init` could not pass `generate-agents --check`: a role row needs `status: "BOUND"`
  (packages and skills say `"READY"`), and nothing said so. `commands/generate-agents.md` now shows
  the role row's exact shape, and the check names which of status, path or `package_paths` is wrong.
- The first ticket after `/sdd init` failed its verifier on the uncommitted init output. Init now
  ends by asking the user to review and commit it. A MICRO ticket stops with a named PENDING on a
  dirty tree instead of failing later; LITE and FULL record every listed path in `input.md`, the baseline's and init's. A
  same-run `init`'s own paths are exempt, and a path already dirty before `init` ran is not.
- The `spec-harness-plan` skill said to apply Grill Me with no size limit, while `commands/sdd.md` says a
  MICRO ticket never asks it. The generated description now says Grill Me is for LITE and FULL only, and the body says a MICRO ticket gets none.

### Changed

- The fast tier's cell names the router's model after a semicolon, so any provider column can give
  the router a smaller model than the implementer.
- `AGENTS.md`: run the tests as a normal user; the permission fixtures fail under root.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-15

### Added

- `spec-harness finalize-init <target> [--dry-run|--apply|--recover] --evidence-dir <dir>`: a guarded
  refresh of the binding-only receipt and inventory. It is a dry run by default. `--apply` writes through
  a journal kept outside the target and rolls back on failure. `--recover` restores the prior bytes after a
  crash. Tests: `tests/finalize-fixtures.sh`.
- `spec-harness doctor <target>`: a read-only setup report covering the prerequisites, the platform and the
  structural and client fields. Tests: `tests/doctor-fixtures.sh`.
- Receipt schema version 3, with a `policy_sources` list and a `policy_coverage` ledger. Schema 1 and 2
  receipts still validate. Proposal: RFC 0003. Tests: `tests/synthesis-contract.sh`.
- `spec-harness status`, `update` (a plan, then `update <target> --apply DIGEST`) and `uninstall` (a plan
  only). Each install writes `.spec-harness/install.json`, which lists what it wrote. Tests:
  `tests/update-fixtures.sh`, `tests/installer-fixtures.sh`.
- Seven update states: `UNCHANGED`, `UPDATE`, `CUSTOMIZED-KEEP`, `MERGE`, `CONFLICT`, `NEW` and
  `REMOVED-UPSTREAM`. A conflict writes a `<file>.spec-harness-proposed` beside your file. Update never
  deletes a file. Tests: `tests/update-fixtures.sh`.
- A stale-synthesis marker, `.spec-harness/synthesis-stale.json`. An update that changes installed files
  after synthesis writes it. `generate-agents --check` refuses READY while it exists. The init procedure
  (`commands/init.md`, step 8) instructs the agent to remove it as the last write of its refresh; no code deletes it.
  Tests: `tests/update-fixtures.sh`, `tests/synthesis-contract.sh`.
- `spec-harness run-state --check <ticket>` validates `.spec-harness/runs/<ticket>/run-state.json`. The
  schema is in `docs/RUN-STATE.md`. Tests: `tests/run-state-fixtures.sh`.
- Six method owners, installed into each project: `ponytail`, `grill-me`, `package-finder`, `skill-finder`,
  `conventions` and `technology-profiles`. Tests: `tests/portable-skills-contract.sh`.
- A Grill Me checkpoint in the plan and SDD procedures. The plan stops for the owner's approval. The approval
  is recorded in the run state's `checkpoint` object, with the SHA-256 of the approved `plan.md`, and not in
  `plan.md` itself, because a file cannot contain its own hash. Procedures: `commands/plan.md`, `commands/sdd.md`.
- The `/sdd`-first rule. A code ticket is any change to a tracked file outside `specs/` and `.memory/`, and
  it goes through `/sdd` before the first source edit. The same sentence is in five source carriers and in
  the four files an install writes. Test: `tests/sdd-rule-carriers.sh`.
- `examples/react-ts-minimal`, a synthetic project with one unusual convention. `tests/examples-smoke.sh`
  runs `index` and `generate-agents --check` on a copy of it.
- RFC 0001 (neutral install route), RFC 0002 (learning statuses), RFC 0003 (receipt schema 3 and
  finalize-init) and RFC 0004 (install record, update, run state and the `/sdd`-first rule).
- A rule-coverage matrix over the complete diff in the reviewer agent. Missing evidence is recorded as
  `PENDING`, and a `PENDING` row never becomes a blocking finding by itself.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a pull request template, and a CI workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`). CI runs the
  suite on Linux and macOS, with Python 3.11 and 3.13 and Node 22. Any skipped check fails the run.

### Changed

- Every `python3` call in `bin/` runs with `-I -B`, so a file in the working directory cannot shadow a
  standard module. Python 3.11 or later is checked before any Python program is parsed. Tests:
  `tests/python-isolation-fixtures.sh`.
- Receipts, inventories, journals, install records and run states are read through `bin/sh_safe_io.py`.
  It refuses symbolic links, FIFOs, devices, files over their size limit and JSON values that are not
  objects. Install records and base copies are written with no-follow at every path component. Tests:
  `tests/safe-read-fixtures.sh`.
- `finalize-init` records the receipt hash in its journal, limits recovery to the files in its write set,
  takes a lock file, and rolls back on SIGINT and SIGTERM. Exit 130 marks an interrupt that was rolled back.
- The inventory digest no longer includes the project folder name, so renaming the folder keeps the hash.
  Tests: `tests/index-fixtures.sh`, `tests/receipt-index-fixtures.sh`.
- The tests and CI no longer need `rg`. They use `grep`, and CI shadows `rg` so any use fails. CI runs
  `env -u TMPDIR npm test` on Linux. macOS runs `npm test`.

### Fixed

- Finalize lock and signals: a lock is removed only when the run created it. A rollback that cannot take
  the lock writes nothing. A failed rollback keeps the lock. A second SIGINT or SIGTERM during the rollback
  is ignored. Signal handlers are installed before the lock is taken. Tests: `tests/finalize-fixtures.sh`.
- Finalize rollback messages: an error the rollback does not name still rolls back during `--apply`. The
  interrupt and refusal messages name a partial rollback, the conflicting files and the original failure.
  Tests: `tests/finalize-fixtures.sh`.
- Finalize restore: a journaled file that this run never wrote is skipped. A failed success print after the
  commit no longer rolls the run back. Each tool step has a 600 second limit.
- `--recover` says whose lock it keeps and prints its own-lock message. Tests: `tests/finalize-fixtures.sh`.
- RFC 0003 and the finalize recovery steps in `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` match the code.
- The install record is read and written through the safe IO module, so a planted `install.json.tmp` link
  is refused. Tests: `tests/installer-fixtures.sh`.
- A `git merge-file` failure (exit status above 127) refuses the plan. It is no longer counted as conflicts.
  Tests: `tests/update-fixtures.sh`.
- The stale marker is written before the first file write, never without a receipt, and is cleared only by
  init. Tests: `tests/update-fixtures.sh`.
- A write refused by the operating system, for example in a read-only folder, is not a traceback. Update
  prints a named `PENDING:` refusal. Install's install-record step prints a named `install record: cannot write`
  message. A failed staging write in install prints `cannot create <path>; target may be partially staged.` for a
  folder or `copy failed for <path>; target may be partially staged.` for a file, and exits 1. Tests: `tests/update-fixtures.sh`, `tests/installer-fixtures.sh`.
- A file that was yours before install is never adopted, flipped to managed, or re-created by update.
  Tests: `tests/update-fixtures.sh`, `tests/installer-fixtures.sh`.
- The uninstall steps live in the README `## Uninstall` section. The Undo section covers `.spec-harness/`,
  and the "no uninstall" statements are removed.
- Every test `python3` run carries `-I -B`, and `tests/python-isolation-fixtures.sh` fails on a run without
  them.
- CI pins Node 22 and prints the tool versions. `AGENTS.md` states that CI runs `npm test` on pull requests
  and on main.
- Generated skills and the context map contain no em dashes.
- The `generate-agents` work order names only the files the shipped set contains.
- The index keeps over-cap sources out of its representative list, and the Codex client directory is
  spelled `.agents/`.
- The README and `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` describe security, network use, sampling, the manifest and the
  citation check as the code does them.
- `/sdd` wording: the duplicate Quickstart paragraph in the README is removed. `commands/sdd.md` states
  that schemas 1 and 2 keep their meaning and that schema 3 adds the ledger. The `/sdd`-first sentence is in
  the step-3 block of `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`.
- The safe-read tests check that `O_NOFOLLOW` is present on both the file open and the directory open. A
  test captures the tar listing before it greps the listing, so GNU tar cannot fail it with SIGPIPE.

### Behaviour changes

- An unnamed exception during `--apply` now rolls back every write. If the rollback finds a conflict, the
  run prints the conflicting files instead.
- A stale finalize lock held by another live program stays until that program exits. The refusal tells you
  to wait. Run `--recover` only after the other program has gone.
- An interrupt that arrives while the Python interpreter is exiting can exit 0 and keep the completed run.
  RFC 0003 section 3 describes this window.
- A user-owned file that you deleted locally is not re-created by `update`.

### Platform support

- macOS and Linux are supported. Native Windows is not. WSL2 works like Linux, and `doctor` says so.

### Security

- Generated rules and third-party skills are data. The skill-finder procedure (`commands/skill-finder.md`) runs
  `npx skills find` only when that discovery route is available, and says discovery never installs a skill.
  No code enforces either rule. They are procedure text, as the README's Security section says.

## 0.3.0

- Earlier release. See the git history for its changes.
