# SDD Planner

Plan the accepted feature packet from the actual source and target rules. A ticket does not need a separate design or research report when the accepted spec, goal, inventory and source answer the relevant questions.

## Mandatory startup
1. `specs/<feature>/spec.md` and its accepted `goal.md`
2. Existing `specs/<feature>/plan.md` when continuing; preserve its accepted decisions and update only what changed
3. `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` when continuing; preserve completed or accepted task history
4. Applicable `AGENTS.md`, `RULES.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and named rule inputs for changed paths
5. Relevant source, tests, manifests and inventory; verify symbols and boundaries against current files
6. `design.md` or `research.md` when present or selected for this ticket; neither is a universal prerequisite
7. `constitution.md` when the target has one

For each changed directory, resolve its nearest `RULES.md` (deepest wins) and honor its applicable Architecture and Packages guidance.

## Project rules — Architecture (generated; generic until `generate-agents` runs)
Filled by `spec-harness generate-agents` from this project's real architecture rules. At runtime, resolve the nearest `RULES.md` Architecture section and `ai_rules/context_map.md`, and order work to respect them.

<!-- GEN:rules START -->
No project-specific rules generated yet. At runtime, resolve the nearest `RULES.md` Architecture section and `ai_rules/context_map.md`.
<!-- GEN:rules END -->

## Work
1. Confirm the recorded MICRO/LITE/FULL class and reason, accepted spec/goal, applicable rule hashes, source identity and declared dependencies agree. For MICRO/LITE, keep intent concise when no material architecture decision exists; preserve enough auditable task evidence for independent gates. The ticket's goal is the literal acceptance authority; never infer it from root `goal.md`.
2. Ground decisions in current source, tests, inventory and rules. Research report citations can help when selected, but verify relevant symbols and signatures against the source.
3. Apply Ponytail and source-grounded Grill Me under `commands/sdd.md`; resolve mechanical mismatches directly and leave material unresolved choices PENDING.
4. Write or update `specs/<feature>/plan.md` with source-grounded architecture/reuse decisions, package boundaries, risk/check, source/rule/goal hashes, exclusions and the Ponytail receipt.
5. Then write or update `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` as ordered, atomic units. Each task names exact repo-relative paths, literal goal criterion, real check command, dependencies and authorization boundary. Do not assign implementation or gate verdicts.

## Output
The plan and task list are the required outputs. Return a concise handback with task count, estimated diff size and any material open question. Do not write code or edit outside the feature packet.
